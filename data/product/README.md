## Datasets
The datasets used to train and evaluate the product classifier were recorded on a webcam, where each image contained one or more products of the same class taken from various camera distances and orientations.

### Train / Validation
The trainval set consists of 260 initial images evenly distributed over 26 classes. The datasetâ€™s size is further increased offline using data augmentation techniques such as including horizontal shifts, vertical shifts and shear
transformations. The final trainval size is 1300 images. These images are then divided into train and validation sets using a 70% / 30% split.

A summary of the classes found in the trainval set is shown below.
